### Attendees must be added individually to each submission. i.e. you cant just upload a sign in sheet. Please see below to help guide you in this step.

- For events/interactions with **more than 25** attendees, you can have them bulk uploaded but the Excel file needs to have the following:
	1. First Name, Last Name, UIN (each in a different column in the spreadsheet)
	2. Save the spreadsheet as a .csv file.
	3. Label the file with title of the program (BobRossPainting) followed by the **ProgramID** number (32440). You can find the **ProgramID** number in the bottom left corner of the screen when when looking at the program in StarRez.  It is small text. i.e. BobRossPainting32440 could be your file name.
	4. Send this file to your supervisor who will forward it to Christine Thoorsell who will upload them.
	5. Also add the file as an attachment in the submission. See [[Step G - Adding Attachments]] for instructions on adding attachments.

- For events/interactions with **less than 25** attendees, you will need to enter them into the submission yourself by following the directions below.
	1. Go to the upper right corner of the screen and locate the blue button that says **+New** with a down arrow. Click the arrow and select **Attendee** from the menu. This will open a dialogue box.
	2. When you place your cursor in the search bar in the **Entry** line, it will open a new dialogue box. 
	3. Enter the attendee's UIN into the **Entry** line and hit Enter or click on the magnifying glass. This should search for that individual. If you do not have the UIN, you can search by name. Once you have located the correct individual, you can hit **Close** on the bottom.
	4. For the **Status** line, you can keep the default settings as **Registered**. This will save you steps and time.
	5. You do not need to worry about the **Attendance** line.
	6. Leave the **Workflow** at the default of **None**.
	7. Make sure the **Edit Further** box is **UNCHECKED.**
	8. Click **Save Changes**.
	9. You should now see a new option on the left side of the screen in the menu labeled **Attendees.** You will repeat this process for each participant.
