1. Once you have completed all the steps in your flow chart up to this point, you are ready to move your submission forward. To do this, select **Main** from the menu on the left side of the screen.
2. In the upper right corner, you will see what looks like a forward button. Click the button and a dialog box will appear called **Move Workflow Step.**
3. The first section called **Add the reason...** is not vital to our process so you may skip this.
4. The next section called **Select who the step will be assigned to** is where you will locate your supervisor’s name from the drop-down list. Select your supervisor’s name and then click **Save**. You can leave a message in the message box, but it is not required.
5. You should now see the **Review & Approve** section of the **Workflow** highlighted blue. This is where your supervisor will review your submission. Should they have any issues with your submission, they may send it backwards in the Workflow to you.
6. If everything is sufficient, they will approve the submission and move it forward in the workflow to the **Complete & Evaluation** stage and assign it back to you.
7. Once your supervisor has assigned the submission back to you with their approval, you are now cleared to hold your event.
