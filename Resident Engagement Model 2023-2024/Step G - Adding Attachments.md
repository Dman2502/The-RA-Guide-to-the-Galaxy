1. Sometimes you will need to add an attachment to your submission. Examples of this include a copy of the purchase authorization(PA), picture of a bulletin board, or a copy of the bulk upload file of attendees. To do this, go to the upper right corner of the screen and locate the blue button that says **+New** with a down arrow. Click on the arrow and select **Attachment** from the menu. This will open a dialog box.
2. Click on **Upload a File** in the upper right corner of the dialog box or drag the file and drop it in the dialog box. You can upload multiple files.
3. Click **Save Changes.**
