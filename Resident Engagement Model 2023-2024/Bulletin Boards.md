To submit a bulletin board on StarRez, head to [[RA Misc Tasks]]

- For opening, bulletin boards will be provided and installed where possible (some buildings might be under construction and unable to be accessed in a timely manner)
- You can make your own content or pull from the BB catalogue *insert link to this*
- If you have multiple boards, all must be done for Opening but only 1 needs to be changed for Board 2 & 3
- These will be required to be entered into StarRez under the [[RA Misc Tasks]] program type and workflow
	- For opening, all boards can be submitted as one entry in StarRez
- Due on the 15th (or first business day after) at 9am
	- September 15, 2023/October 16, 2023 and February 15, 2024/March 18, 2024 (due to spring break)
- Boards do not need to be cleared at end of Fall semester. Spring's can be completed prior to departure for winter break. For Spring closing, content must be removed but boards should be left with backing and borders that are in good shape for use during the summer.
- The Bulletin Board Library will be available for RAs to access via the large Resident Advisor Team.
- If you have content for a board you have used previously and would like it to be added into the Library, please send it to gennie_lynn@reslife.tamu.edu
