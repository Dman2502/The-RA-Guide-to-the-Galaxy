The 2023-2024 academic year will have a fresh new focus in our residential living areas. Gone are individual RA programming requirements. Now there is going to be a focus on building connections in each RA's area/wing/ramp/floor and building so the residents feel like they belong in the community. Planned programs will only be required to be coordinated by the supervisor and it will be an all hall/staff program. Below are the different aspects of the new model with specific information for each aspect. Please note things are subject to change if we find something is not working or we receive feedback on the model. Included are also the other expectations of your position as an RA which can aid in building community such as Bulleting Boards, Door Decorations, and Roommate Agreements.
