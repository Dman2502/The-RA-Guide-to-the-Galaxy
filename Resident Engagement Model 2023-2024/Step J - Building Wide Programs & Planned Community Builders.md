1. Building Wide programs will be submitted by the Live-In Supervisor. Planned CBs will be submitted by the RA. 
2. After completing Step A, proceed to the next section titled **What is the Program Type.** Click on the box that says **Program Type** and a dropdown menu will appear. For this process, select **Building Program.**
3. In the **Program Sub Type,** please select if your submission is a **Planned Active** or **Planned Passive** event. 
	- A **Planned Active** event can be described as an event/interaction done in person where people are actively engaging in an activity or with other people.
	- A **Planned Passive** event can be described as an event/interaction where people are not actively engaging with others, but they may be engaging in something. An example would be an interactive bulletin board or a finals goodie bag program that included study tips. 
4. In the **Title** box, please enter either the title of the planned CB or Building Wide program.
5. For the **Description** of a **Planned** event, see below.
	- Describe what the event is about, what will be taking place, activities that might be included, etc.
	- Utilize the **Guiding Questions and Template for Inclusion and Sustainability** document to answer those prompts to help you think a little more about your event.
6. At the bottom of this dialog box, you will see where it says **Workflow** with a drop-down menu. It defaults to **Program Submission** and this is the one you want.
7. Make sure the **Edit Further** Box is checked and click **Save Changes.**
