1. Once you have selected your term, proceed to the next section titled **What is the Program Type.** Click on the box that says **Program Type** and a drop-down menu will appear. For this process, select **Community Builder.** 
2. In the **Program Sub Type,** please select the appropriate entry for your CB. Either **Planned, Spontaneous,** or **Support.**
3. If you are submitting a **Planned** CB, please go to [[Step J - Building Wide Programs & Planned Community Builders]] and complete your submission following the **Building Wide Programs** process. 
4. If you are submitting a **Spontaneous** or **Support** CB, please select the appropriate choice. 
5. In the **Title** box, please enter either the title of the Support program you attended or enter the month and which CB you are submitting (i.e. “September CB 1”, “October CB 2”, etc…).
6. For the **Description** of a **Spontaneous** CB, please be detailed enough in the description so someone can tell what was discussed and/or what occurred. However, ***==DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PERSONAL OR IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESIDENTS IN THE DESCRIPTION!==***
7. For the **Description** of a **Support** CB, please list a summary of the event, who hosted, etc. 
8. At the bottom of this dialogue box, you will see where it says **Workflow** with a drop-down menu. It defaults to **Program Submission** but you will need to change it to **RA Misc & Community Builders.** This will drastically reduce the number of steps both you and your supervisor will need to complete. 
9. Make sure the **Edit Further** box is checked and click **Save Changes.**
