1. Once you have selected your term, proceed to the next section titled **What is the Program Type.** Click on the box that says **Program Type** and a dropdown menu will appear. For this process, select **RA Misc.**
2. In the **Program Sub Type**, please select if your submission is a **Door Decoration, Bulletin Board,** or **Roommate Agreements.**
3. In the Title box, please enter the title of the task.
	- For **Door Decorations,** put what they are or the title. i.e. *Lava Lamp Door Decorations.*
	- For **Bulletin Boards,** please put the name of your bulletin board. i.e. if your board is on study tips, put something similar to *Study Tips 101 Bulletin Board.*
	- For **Roommate Agreements,** title it as your floor/wing/area/ramp name. I.e. *Eppright 1st Floor Roommate Agreements.**
4. For the **Description** of a RA Misc Tasks, the only one which actually needs a description would be the Roommate Agreements. For **Roommate Agreements,** you can either upload all of the agreements into one submission (See [[Step G - Adding Attachments]]) or put the link to the Google Drive where you have them saved (see your supervisor for their preferred method).
5. At the bottom of this dialog box, you will see where it says **Workflow** with a drop-down menu. It defaults to Program Submission but you will need to change it to **RA Misc & Community Builders.** This will drastically reduce the number of steps both you and your supervisor will need to complete.
6. Make sure the **Edit Further** box is checked and click **Save Changes.**
