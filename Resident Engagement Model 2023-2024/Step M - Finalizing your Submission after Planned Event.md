1. Once you have added in your Attendees ([Step F - Entering Attendees](Step%20F%20-%20Entering%20Attendees.md)) and completed your Evaluation ([Step E - Evaluation](Step%20E%20-%20Evaluation.md)) portion of the submission for any planned events, make sure you add final copies of any advertisement and/or PA’s as attachments ([Step G - Adding Attachments](Step%20G%20-%20Adding%20Attachments.md)).
2. After you have completed all of the previous steps, you are ready to move your final submission forward for final review by your supervisor. To do this, select **Main** from the menu on the left side of the screen.
3. In the upper right corner, you will see what looks like a forward button. Click the button and a dialog box will appear called **Move Workflow Step**.
4. The first section called **Add the reason...** is not vital to our process so you may skip this.
5. The next section called **Select who the step will be assigned to** is where you will locate your supervisor’s name from the drop-down list. Select your supervisor’s name and then click **Save**. You can leave a message in the message box, but it is not required.
6. You should now see the **Supervisor Final Review** section of the **Workflow** highlighted blue. This is where your supervisor will review your final submission. Should they have any issues with your submission, they may send it backwards in the Workflow to you.
7. If everything is sufficient, they will move forward in the workflow to the **Closed (Prog)** stage and you are done.

#### Next Steps:
CBs (planned) -> Complete! Unless sent back by supervisor.
