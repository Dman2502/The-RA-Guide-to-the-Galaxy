1. Next, you need to complete the **Evaluation** portion of the submission. To complete this step, click on **Evaluation** from the menu on the left side of the screen. In the upper right corner, click the **Edit** button. This will open a dialog box. 
2. On the line labeled **Program Outcome,** you will see it is a drop-down menu. Please select the best option for your submission after referring to the information bellow which will help you determine your selection.
	- **Average:** Has some residents attend (mostly people who typically attend events). Some people seemed to talk and connect. Some people engaged in the activities. Had some residents attend for 5 minutes or less (of those who attended, most stayed for a significant period of time.) Residents seemed to enjoy themselves. 
	- **Could Have Been Better:** Less attendance or engagement than "Average."
	- **Success:** More attendance or engagement than "Average."
3. On the next line, **Attendee Actual,** please enter the number of attendees to your event/interaction. This would include residents who showed up for more than just food, if offered. They stayed for the entirety of the event and engaged with other residents and/or the RA(s). Other RAs do not count towards this number.
4. For the next two sections, **Highlights** and **Improvements,** please read bellow to help complete these sections they are applicable. Spontaneous CBs may not be applicable.
	- Please identify/recall/state the activities and communications that occurred.
	- What was the main idea/purpose/goal of your event?
	- Is there another format/way/idea that could have been used to achieve your idea/purpose/goal better than the method you used? Explain why or why not.
	- Please compare/contrast the differences between your main idea/purpose/goal and what occurred at your event.
	- How would you create/design the event differently if future RAs were to host this event?
	- Ultimately, answer what went well in the **Highlights** section and what went poorly in the **Improvements** section.
