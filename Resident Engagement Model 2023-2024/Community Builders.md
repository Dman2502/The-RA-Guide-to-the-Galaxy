Community Builders (CBs) are the focus for the RAs in each living area. You should think of these as ways to get to know your residents better in a more informal setting. These interactions do not have to be structured or planned.

### Community Builder Specifics:
- Should be intentional conversations with residents in an effort to get to know them better.
- 2 per month minimum
	- Sept/Oct/Nov and Feb/Mar/Apr
- Designed to be spontaneous
	- Can be planned if you wanted to plan something specific
		- There is a hard 2-week prior deadline for submissions on any planned activity
		- Funding is available. If funding is used, there is a 24-hour post event attendee list and evaluation deadline
		- This will utilize the standard program submission in StarRez
	- Does not have to be programmatic
	- Be creative!
- Still submitted into StarRez within 72 hours (about 3 days) after the interaction. This is a hard headline for spontaneous and support only. Failure to submit within this time limit will result in the CB not counting.
	- There is a different submission process in StarRez for CBs (see guides listed above). It is much more simplified than previous programming entries
	- Evaluation portion should be included in submission for spontaneous and support CBs
		- Refer to [[Step E - Evaluation]]
	- *==Description of the CB should be detailed but not sharing any personal or identifiable information about any resident==*
- One CB a semester per RA must be APM related
	- See [[Working with CSI]] for more details
- CBs will be tracked in StarRez and in whatever method your supervisor prefers
	- Example: Roster tracking
	- Attendees will be tracked as well
		- You should strive to add at least one new person to each CB so it is not only the same people attending repeatedly
		- You will discuss this in your 1:1 with your supervisor so if you have someone who you have tried to make contact with, but they are not responding, you can inform your supervisor
	- Supervisors will have final decisions on all submissions

#### Things to think about:
- Examples of acceptable Community Builders (not an extensive list)
	- Grabbing a coffee/meal with residents
	- 1:1 with a resident to an event
	- Taking people to events hosted by other halls/areas of campus (think support programs)
	- First 6 Weeks programming - anything over the minimum of 2 events (Not August)
	- Going to another communities Monthly Building Wide program
- Examples of things that would not qualify as CBs (not an extensive list)
	- 1:1 conversation with a resident that does not expose them to campus activities
	- Roommate Agreements and conversations
	- Floor meetings (opening & closing)
