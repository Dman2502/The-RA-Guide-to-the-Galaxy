1. Once you have completed all the steps in your flow chart, you are ready to move your submission forward. To do this, select **Main** from the menu on the left side of the screen.
2. In the upper right corner, you will see what looks like a forward button. Click the button and a dialog box will appear called **Move Workflow Step.**
3. The first section called **Add the reason...** is not vital to our process so you may skip this.
4. The next section called **Select who the step will be assigned to** is where you will locate your supervisor’s name from the drop-down list. Select your supervisor’s name and then click **Save**. You can leave a message in the message box, but it is not required.\
5. You should now see the **Review & Approve** section of the **Workflow** highlighted blue. At this point, you are done unless your supervisor sends the submission back because it is missing something.

#### Next Steps:
CBs (spontaneous/support) -> Complete! Unless sent back by supervisor.

RA Misc Tasks -> Complete! Unless sent back by supervisor.
